Privacy Policy
The Tasbih App is committed to protecting user privacy and ensuring transparency in how we handle user data. This privacy policy outlines the data we collect, how it is used, and the measures we take to protect it, in compliance with Google Play’s User Data policy and applicable regulations like the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
Data Collection
The Tasbih App collects minimal data to provide its core functionality:

Usage Data: The app stores the total count of Adhkar performed and user preferences (e.g., dark mode, vibration settings) locally on the device using SharedPreferences.
No Personal Data: The app does not collect personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, location, or device identifiers.
No Third-Party Data Sharing: The app does not share any user data with third parties, as it does not integrate analytics, advertising, or other data-sharing services.
Children’s Data: The app is suitable for all ages, including children under 13. It does not collect any data that requires parental consent under COPPA, as all data is stored locally and not transmitted.

Data Usage

Local Storage: The total count and user preferences are stored locally to maintain continuity between app sessions.
Purpose: Data is used solely to enhance the user experience (e.g., tracking progress, maintaining theme preferences).

Data Security

All data is stored locally on the user’s device and is not transmitted over the internet.
The app employs standard device security measures provided by the operating system to protect stored data.

User Rights

Users can reset their total count at any time via the app’s reset button.
Since no personal data is collected, there are no additional user data access or deletion requests to process.

Third-Party Services

The app uses the vibration package for haptic feedback and shared_preferences for local storage. Neither package collects or transmits user data to external servers.

Compliance with COPPA
The Tasbih App is designed to be safe for children under 13, as it:

Does not collect personal or sensitive data.
Does not display advertisements.
Does not require user accounts or online connectivity.
Complies with Google Play’s Families Policy for apps targeting children.

No Misrepresentation: Do not claim the app collects no data if any third-party SDKs are added in the future.
Children’s Privacy: If targeting children under 13, ensure the app remains free of ads and data collection requiring parental consent.
